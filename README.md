# Decentralized Manufacturing Quality Control

This repository contains a suite of smart contracts designed to manage quality control processes in decentralized manufacturing environments. By leveraging blockchain technology, these contracts create a transparent, immutable record of the manufacturing process from facility verification through final certification.

## Core Components

### Facility Verification Contract
Validates and registers legitimate production sites within the manufacturing network, ensuring that only authorized facilities can participate in the production process.

### Component Tracking Contract
Creates a comprehensive record of all parts used during assembly, enabling full traceability of components throughout the supply chain.

### Testing Protocol Contract
Manages standardized quality assurance procedures, ensuring consistent testing methodologies across all manufacturing facilities.

### Defect Tracking Contract
Documents identified quality issues and their subsequent resolutions, creating accountability and facilitating continuous improvement.

### Certification Contract
Handles the final approval process for manufactured goods, generating verifiable certification records before distribution.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Transparency**: All manufacturing data is recorded on an immutable ledger accessible to authorized participants.
- **Improved Traceability**: Complete component and process history allows for rapid identification of potential issues.
- **Standardized Quality Control**: Consistent testing protocols ensure uniform quality standards regardless of manufacturing location.
- **Streamlined Compliance**: Automated certification processes reduce administrative overhead while maintaining regulatory adherence.
